Test Case file descriptions:

PDUs:

DATA IN:

PDUDataIn128K.xml :
PDUDataIn512B.xml :
PDUDataIn64K.xml :
One-part full response to a 128K, 512, or 64K Read command.

PDUDataIn32K_I.xml :
PDUDataIn32K_F.xml :
If the host has somehow negotiated the Maximum receiveable segment length to 32K (ie. by using PDULogin2_32K.xml during login or using text negotiation) and does a read of greater than 32K, these represent, respectively, an intermediate (or initial) and final 32K long Data IN response.

Example: a 128K read with 32K MaxRecvDataSegmentLen would respond with 3x PDUDataIn32K_I followed by 1 PDUDataIn32K_F.

PDUDataIn64KGeneric.xml : A 64K read response that is blind to its data structure, as long as there's 64K of data attached.

DATA OUT :

PDUDataOut21K.xml :
PDUDataOut21K_2.xml :
PDUDataOut22K.xml :
A three-PDU ordered write in response to a 64K R2T in which 64K has already been transferred (ie. a SCSI WRITE command with 64K of immediate data).

PDUDataOut64K.xml : A one-shot 64K write with the background situation above.

LOGIN/OUT:

PDULogin1.xml  :
PDULogin1rsp.xml :
PDULogin2.xml  :
PDULogin2rsp.xml:
Taken as a whole these 4 PDU's will get the bridge into full feature phase.

PDULogoutSession.xml :
PDULogoutConnection.xml :
PDULogoutRspOK.xml :
The first two will log a session or connection out of the device, and will generate the RspOK.

PDULogoutConnRecovery.xml :
Will attempt to logout a connection using ERL 2 Recovery, and should generate the RspOK.

PDULogoutRspNoConnRec.xml :
If PDULogoutConnRecovery is attempted with a connection ERL less than 2, this response will be returned.

PDULogoutBadAhs.xml:
PDULogoutBadDataLen:
These PDUs have erroneous fields, and should receive reject responses.

PDULogoutBadCID.xml :
PDULogoutRspBadCID.xml :
A logout request with the wrong CID, and its response.

PDULogoutRspCleanFailed.xml :
Will be the response to a logout that failed to clean up the connection.


NOP:

PDUNopOut.xml :
PDUNopIn.xml :
A properly-formed NOP-Out "ping" and its response.

PDUNopOutPingData.xml :
PDUNopInPingData.xml :
The above with attached "ping" data.

PDUNopOutBadITT.xml :
PDUNopOutBadTTT.xml :
NOP-Outs with an erroneous ITT or TTT.  They should receive reject responses.

R2Ts:

PDUR2T128K.xml :
PDUR2T64K.xml :
R2Ts requesting 128K and 64K writes respectively.

SCSI COMMAND:

PDUTestUnitReady.xml : Check's if a unit is ready to transfer data.  If PDUScsiStatusGood is
received as a response, you're good to go.

SCSI_READ:

PDUScsiRead128K.xml :
PDUScsiRead512B.xml :
PDUScsiRead64K.xml :
PDUTestRead.xml :
Command to read 128K, 512, 64K, and 8K bytes respectively from LUN 0. No immediate data.

SCSI RESPONSE:

PDUScsiStatusGood.xml : Reports STATUS_GOOD.

BINARIES:

login1_ipb2600100029.bin  : LEN = 9C  Data for the first login request on a 
bridge named ipb2600100029, with a default target mapped.  Login is for a normal 
session with no authentication.

login1rsp.bin : LEN = 28  Data for login response corresponding 
with ipb2600100029.bin

login2.bin : LEN = 12C Data to negotiate parameters -	includes the following
	- Immediate data on
	- Max Recvdatasegment length 64k
	- Max Burst Length 256K
	- First Burst Length 64K

login2rsp.bin : LEN = 120  Data for login response corresponding with login2.bin

login2_32K.bin : LEN = 12C Identical to login2.bin except the Max Recvdatasegment 
length is 32k.
